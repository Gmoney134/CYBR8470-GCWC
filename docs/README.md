# User Stories:
As a **Golfer**, I want to **View estimated distances of my golf clubs based on the weather in my location** so I can **improve my golf game by having more accurate distances and taking guesswork out of the equation**.

As a **Admin**, I want to **be able to manage all data and users within the application** so I can **see what is going on in my application and use for dev purposes**.
### Acceptance Criteria: 
**Golfer:** this user story will be done when the application is complete and works without any bugs.

**Admin:** this user story will be done when the backend is complete and the admin user works as intedned.

# Mis-user Stories
As a **Hacker**, I want to **infiltrate the account of other users** so I can **learn location wearabouts of that user**.

As a **Malicious-user**, I want to **input false or unrealistic data** so I can **break the calculation algorithm to cause issues with the application such as a crash**.

### Mitigation Criteria:
**Hacker:** I will be done protecting against this mis-user story when there is a secure authentication system implemented and location data is secure.

**Malicious-user:** I will be done protecting against this mis-user story when there is appropriate error handling for unrealistic data such that the calculation algorithm cannot be exploited.
